classes and objects

class is a blueprint, and its object is the real use.

Polymorphism means poly-many morphs-forms, means many forms.
Polymorphism ka best example hai function overloading, because same name  methods are made, only difference 
is that the passed arguments. this is compile time Polymorphism

static ka matlab ki wo ab class ki property ho gayi hai, object ki property nahi hai.
seedhe class_name.method() ko call karke invike kar sakte hai isko, no need to create object to call that
method, examle count variable ko one se increment karte hai jab node  banayi jaati hai.

This keyword is used  to call a constructor which has been made above if more than one constructor has been made
issliye kyuki pehle upar wala constructor call ho, jab doosra wala parameterised constructer manually 
call kiya jayega toh. basically constructor overloading ke time.
